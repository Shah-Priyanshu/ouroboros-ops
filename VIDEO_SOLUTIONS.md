# Video Display Solutions for GitHub

## ðŸŽ¥ Current Issue
GitHub doesn't natively play MP4 files in the browser. Users need to download the file to watch it.

## ðŸ”§ Solutions

### Solution 1: Install FFmpeg and Convert to GIF
```bash
# Install FFmpeg on Windows
winget install FFmpeg

# Or download from: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
# Add to PATH environment variable

# Then run our converter
python convert_video_to_gif.py
```

### Solution 2: Online Conversion (Quick)
1. **Upload MP4 to online converter**:
   - https://convertio.co/mp4-gif/
   - https://cloudconvert.com/mp4-to-gif
   - Optimize for web (reduce size)

2. **Recommended GIF settings**:
   - Max width: 720px
   - Frame rate: 15-20 FPS
   - Duration: Full (18.8s)
   - Quality: Medium-High

### Solution 3: Host on External Platform
- **YouTube** (unlisted/private)
- **Vimeo** 
- **GitHub Releases** (as downloadable asset)

### Solution 4: Use Raw GitHub Link (Current)
The README now includes direct download links that work better:
```markdown
[ðŸ“º Watch Video](https://github.com/Shah-Priyanshu/ouroboros-ops/raw/main/docs/demo_video.mp4)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Approach
1. **Short term**: Use the updated README with raw GitHub links
2. **Long term**: Convert to optimized GIF for inline display
3. **Optional**: Upload to YouTube for broader reach

## ðŸ“Š File Size Considerations
- Current MP4: 7.8 MB
- Expected GIF: 15-25 MB (larger but displays inline)
- Optimized GIF: 8-12 MB (good quality, manageable size)
